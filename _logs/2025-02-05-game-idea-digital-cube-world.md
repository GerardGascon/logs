## Idea

I've recently discovered this physical toy and I quite liked the concept.

The idea of this project is to create a digital pet for computers similar to the Cube World virtual pet.

## Execution

As the original game required physical cubes in order to play it, in this game you could use different windows
for each character.

Using Godot Engine you could easily create new windows and keep track of them, being able to create a similar
experience.

## Some doubts

Obviously, one of the charms about this toy is the fact that you can connect with friends and exchange these cubes to 
make your little worlds grow.

If I ever turn this into reality:

1. I will try finding a way to make this exchange viable.
2. It won't be a 1:1 version of the physical toy, but rather an \*_inspired by_\* game.
