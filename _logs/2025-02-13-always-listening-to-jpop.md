My music tastes have changed drastically during my life, I want to break it down because it's quite fun to see.

1. Catalan Music (Txarango, Catarres, Els Pets...)
2. International Pop
3. Steam Punk
4. Ska Punk (Streetlight Manifesto my beloved)
5. Steam Punk again
6. Swing
7. Japanese Swing
8. JPop, JRock, and so on.

Simply, yeah.

## What happens now

A few weeks ago I got a Raspberry Pi CM5 in my hands and now have the power to self-host things.

So what do I do? Self-host ZUTOMAYO concerts because they are the freaking best concerts in the world, but they don't
play in Europe :(

So yeah, now I can watch whenever I want how ACAね starts cooking rice mid-concert.

And that's my weird obsession with Japanese music, something that somehow I stumped upon with at some point in life and
suddenly fell in love with.
